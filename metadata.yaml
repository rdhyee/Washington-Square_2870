description: Washington Square is a short novel by Henry James. Originally published
  in 1880 as a serial in Cornhill Magazine and Harper's New Monthly Magazine, it is
  a structurally simple tragicomedy that recounts the conflict between a dull but
  sweet daughter and her brilliant, domineering father. The plot of the novel is based
  upon a true story told to James by his close friend, British actress Fanny Kemble.
  The book is often compared to Jane Austen's work for the clarity and grace of its
  prose and its intense focus on family relationships ...
